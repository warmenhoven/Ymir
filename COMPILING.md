# Compiling Ymir

Ymir requires [CMake 3.28+](https://cmake.org/) and a C++20 compiler.

The repository includes several vendored dependencies as Git submodules. When cloning, make sure to include the `--recurse-submodules` parameter.
You can also initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive` after a `git clone` or when pulling changes.

Ymir has been successfully compiled with the following toolchains:
- Visual Studio 2022's Clang 19.1.5
- Visual Studio 2022's MSVC 19.44.35213.0
- Visual Studio 2026's Clang 20.1.8
- Visual Studio 2026's MSVC 19.50.35724.0
- Clang 15.0.7 on WSL Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS (`clang-15` / `clang++-15`)
- Clang 18.1.3 on WSL Ubuntu 24.04.5 LTS (`clang` / `clang++`)
- Clang 19.1.1 on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (`clang-19` / `clang++-19`)
- GCC 14.2.0 on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (`gcc-14` / `g++-14`)
- Clang 19.1.7 on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE (`clang19` / `clang++19`)
- Clang 21.1.0 on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE (`clang21` / `clang++21`)
- Apple Clang 17 on macOS 15 Sequoia

The project has been compiled for x86_64 and ARM64 Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and macOS platforms.

Clang is the preferred compiler for it's multiplatform support and excellent code generation. Ymir requires Clang 15 or later.


## Build configuration

You can tune the build with following CMake options:

- `Ymir_AVX2` (`BOOL`): Set to `ON` to use AVX2 extensions (on x86_64 platforms only). `OFF` uses the platform's default instruction set, typically SSE2. ARM64 platforms will always use NEON. Disabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_SDL3_APP` (`BOOL`): Includes the SDL3 frontend in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_LIBRETRO` (`BOOL`): Includes the libretro core in the build. Disabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_TESTS` (`BOOL`): Includes the unit test project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_SANDBOX` (`BOOL`): Includes the sandbox project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_YMDASM` (`BOOL`): Includes the disassembly tool project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_IPO` (`BOOL`): Enables interprocedural optimizations (also called link-time optimizations) on all projects. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_DEVLOG` (`BOOL`): Enables logs meant to aid development. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_DEV_ASSERTIONS` (`BOOL`): Enables development assertions, meant to mark code as incomplete or for potential bugs. Disabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_IMGUI_DEMO` (`BOOL`): Enables the ImGui demo window, useful as a reference when developing new UI elements. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECKS` (`BOOL`): Enables automatic update checks and onboarding process. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_EXTRA_INLINING` (`BOOL`): Enables more aggressive inlining, which slows down the build in exchange for better runtime performance. Only applies to Clang, which handles heavy inlining much better than GCC or MSVC. Disabled by default.
- `Ymir_PGO` (`STRING`): PGO mode. Valid values are `OFF`, `GENERATE`, `USE`. Defaults to `OFF`.
- `Ymir_PGO_DIR` (`PATH`): Directory where PGO profile data is written. Defaults to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/pgo-profdata`.
- `Ymir_PGO_PROFDATA` (`FILEPATH`): Merged LLVM PGO profile data path. Defaults to `${Ymir_PGO_DIR}/ymir.profdata`.

For a Release build, you might want to disable the devlog and ImGui demo window and enable extra inlining to maximize performance and reduce the binary size.

It is highly recommended to use [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) as it greatly accelerates the build process, especially on machines with high CPU core counts.


## Building on Windows

To build Ymir on Windows, you will need [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or later and [CMake 3.28+](https://cmake.org/).
Clang is highly recommended over MSVC as it produces much higher quality code, outperforming MSVC by 50-80%. However, MSVC tends to provide a better debugging experience.

All dependencies are included through `vcpkg` and in the `vendor` directory, and are built together with the emulator. No external dependencies are needed.

You can choose to generate a .sln file with CMake or open the directory directly with Visual Studio.
Both methods work, but opening the directory allows Visual Studio to use Ninja for significantly faster build times.
If you choose to generate the .sln file, you will need to specify the vcpkg toolchain:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Ymir uses custom Windows triplets to ensure all libraries are statically linked when possible. You can find the overridden triplets in the `vcpkg-triplets` folder.


## Building on Linux

To build Ymir on Linux, first you will need to install SDL3's required dependencies. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-linux) to install them.

The compiler of choice for this platform is Clang. GCC is also supported, but produces slightly slower code.

Use CMake to generate a Makefile or (preferably) a Ninja build script:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Pass additional `-D<option>=<value>` parameters to tune the build. See the [Build configuration](#build-configuration) section above for details.

You can use CMake to build the project, regardless of generator:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
```


## Building on FreeBSD

Install required packages:

```sh
pkg install cmake evdev-proto git gmake libX11 libXcursor libXext libXfixes libXi \
    libXrandr libXrender libXScrnSaver libXtst libglvnd libinotify llvm19 ninja patchelf \
    pkgconf python3 vulkan-loader zip
```

Notes:
- A default FreeBSD installation provides a stripped-down LLVM toolchain which lacks
  the required `clang-scan-deps` binary. Therefore it is necessary to install a
  complete LLVM toolchain package, e.g. `llvm19`.
- The usage of CMake's "Precompile Headers" feature triggers a compiler bug in LLVM
  prior to version 21 for ARM64 builds on FreeBSD. Therefore it is necessary to install
  and use at least `llvm21` for ARM64.

Configure build:

```sh
CXX=clang++19 \
CC=clang19 \
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Notes:
- By default vcpkg and CMake will use the stripped-down LLVM toolchain instead of
  the previously installed complete toolchain. Therefore it is necessary to set
  the `CXX` and `CC` environment variables to the correct compilers.

Pass additional `-D<option>=<value>` parameters to tune the build. See the [Build configuration](#build-configuration) section above for details.

Build:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
```

Ymir uses SDL3's Dialog API. This requires an installed dialog driver in order for
the file dialogs to work in Ymir. Install Zenity:

```sh
pkg install zenity
```


## Building on macOS

Use CMake to generate a Makefile or (preferably) a Ninja build script:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Pass additional `-D<option>=<value>` parameters to tune the build. See the [Build configuration](#build-configuration) section above for details.

You can use CMake to build the project, regardless of generator:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
```


After building, you will find the .app bundle at:
```sh
build/apps/ymir-sdl3/ymir-sdl3.app
```


## Profile Guided Optimization (PGO)

PGO is supported for Clang/AppleClang and GCC (MSVC PGO may be added in future releases).
Use a two-phase build: first generate profile data, then rebuild using that data.


### Windows - Visual Studio IDE, open folder

With the project opened as a folder:
1. Select the **x64 Clang Release/Dist [arch] PGO (Generate)** target.
2. Build and run a representative workload. This will produce a `.profraw` file in `out\pgo-profdata\windows\x86_64-[arch]`.
3. In the **Solution Explorer** view, switch to the **CMake Targets** view. You can also find it in the **View** menu.
4. Build the **`ymir-pgo-merge`** utility target. This will combine the `.profraw` files into `ymir.profdata`.
5. Select the **x64 Clang Release/Dist [arch] PGO (Use)** target.
6. Build and run. This build will use profile-guided optimization with the profiling data you acquired from the previous run.


### Windows - Visual Studio command line tools

1. Launch the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022/2026.
2. Generate an instrumented build:

    ```cmd
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-gen -G Ninja ^
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ^
      -DYmir_PGO=GENERATE
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --parallel
    ```

3. Run a representative workload and emit `.profraw` into the PGO directory:

    ```cmd
    set LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="%CD%\build-pgo-gen\pgo-profdata\ymir_%p.profraw"
    .\build-pgo-gen\apps\ymir-sdl3\ymir-sdl3
    ```

4. Merge the raw profiles using the CMake target:

    ```cmd
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --target ymir-pgo-merge
    ```

    Or manually with `llvm-profdata`:

    ```cmd
    llvm-profdata merge ^
      -o "%CD%\build-pgo-gen\pgo-profdata\ymir.profdata" ^
      "%CD%\build-pgo-gen\pgo-profdata"\*.profraw
    ```

5. Build using the merged profile:

    ```cmd
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-use -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
      -DYmir_PGO=USE ^
      -DYmir_PGO_PROFDATA="%CD%\build-pgo-gen\pgo-profdata\ymir.profdata"
    cmake --build build-pgo-use --parallel
    ```



### Linux and macOS - Clang / AppleClang

1. Generate an instrumented build:

    **Linux**
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-gen -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
      -DYmir_PGO=GENERATE
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --parallel
    ```

    **macOS**
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-gen -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$PWD/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" \
      -DYmir_PGO=GENERATE
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --parallel
    ```

2. Run a representative workload and emit `.profraw` into the PGO directory:

    ```sh
    export LLVM_PROFILE_FILE="$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata/ymir_%p.profraw"
    ./build-pgo-gen/apps/ymir-sdl3/ymir-sdl3
    ```

3. Merge the raw profiles using the CMake target:

    ```sh
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --target ymir-pgo-merge
    ```

    Or manually with `llvm-profdata`:

    ```sh
    llvm-profdata merge \
      -o "$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata/ymir.profdata" \
      "$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata"/*.profraw
    ```

4. Build using the merged profile:

    **Linux**
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-use -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DYmir_PGO=USE \
      -DYmir_PGO_PROFDATA="$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata/ymir.profdata"
    cmake --build build-pgo-use --parallel
    ```

    **macOS**
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-use -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$PWD/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" \
      -DYmir_PGO=USE \
      -DYmir_PGO_PROFDATA="$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata/ymir.profdata"
    cmake --build build-pgo-use --parallel
    ```

### GCC

1. Generate an instrumented build:

    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-gen -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DYmir_PGO=GENERATE
    cmake --build build-pgo-gen --parallel
    ```

2. Run a representative workload to emit `.gcda` data into `build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata/gcc`:

    ```sh
    ./build-pgo-gen/apps/ymir-sdl3/ymir-sdl3
    ```

    Profiles will appear in the subdirectory tree, not flat.

3. Build using the generated profiles (point the use build at the generate build directory):

    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build-pgo-use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DYmir_PGO=USE \
      -DYmir_PGO_DIR="$PWD/build-pgo-gen/pgo-profdata"
    cmake --build build-pgo-use --parallel
    ```
