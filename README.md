## Usage

Grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/StrikerX3/Ymir/releases/latest).
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/StrikerX3/Ymir/releases) page for previous versions.

Ymir does not require installation. Simply download it to any directory and run the executable.
On Windows you might also need to install the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) ([x86_64 installer](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), [AArch64/ARM64 installer](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe)).

The program accepts command-line arguments. Invoke `ymir-sdl3 --help` to list the options:

```
Ymir - Sega Saturn emulator
Usage:
  Ymir [OPTION...] path to disc image

  -d, --disc arg      Path to Saturn disc image (.ccd, .chd, .cue, .iso, 
                      .mds)
  -p, --profile arg   Path to profile directory
  -u, --user          Force user profile
  -h, --help          Display help text
  -f, --fullscreen    Start in fullscreen mode
  -P, --paused        Start paused
  -F, --fast-forward  Start in fast-forward mode
  -D, --debug         Start with debug tracing enabled
  -E, --exceptions    Capture all unhandled exceptions

```

The options are case-sensitive -- lowercase `-p` sets the profile path, uppercase `-P` makes the emulator start paused.

Pass a path to a valid Saturn disc image as an argument to `ymir-sdl3` to launch the emulator with the disc. `-d`/`--disc` is optional.

Use `-p <profile-path>` to point to a separate set of configuration and state files, useful if you wish to have different user profiles (hence the name).

The `-u` option forces usage of the OS's user profile folder (e.g. `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\StrikerX3\Ymir` on Windows or `/home/<username>/.local/share/Ymir` on Linux).

`-f` forces the emulator to start in fullscreen mode, ignoring the preference in Ymir.toml.

`-D` starts the emulator with debug tracing enabled.

`-F` starts the emulator in fast-forward mode.

`-E` captures all unhandled exceptions, which can be useful to troubleshoot crashes or failure to start the emulator.

Note that the Windows version does not output anything to the console, but it does honor the command line parameters. You can pipe the output of the command to a file:

```sh
ymir-sdl3 > out.txt
```

Ymir requires an IPL (BIOS) ROM to work. You can place the ROMs under the `roms\ipl` directory created alongside the executable on the first run.
The emulator will scan and automatically select the IPL ROM matching the loaded disc. If no disc is loaded, it will use a ROM matching the first preferred region. Failing that, it will pick whatever is available.
You can override the selection on Settings > IPL.

Ymir can load game disc images from MAME CHD, BIN+CUE, IMG+CCD, MDF+MDS or ISO files. It does not support injecting .elf files directly at the moment.

When using low level CD block emulation (LLE), Ymir also requires the CD block ROM to be placed in `roms\cdb`.


## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if the emulator crashes or misbehaves.

> [!NOTE]
> The author (@StrikerX3) works primarily with Windows and Linux systems and only provides support for other platforms on a best-effort basis.
> For Linux specifically, only the .tar.xz package on Ubuntu (both native and under WSL) is officially supported by the author.
> If you use custom-built Linux systems or anything that deviates too much from the norm, you're most likely on your own.
>
> The project relies on community support for other Linux packages, macOS and FreeBSD.
